# Authenticating requests

To authenticate requests, include an **`Authorization`** header with the value **`"Bearer Bearer {YOUR_TOKEN}"`**.

All authenticated endpoints are marked with a `requires authentication` badge in the documentation below.

To use this API, send your token in the Authorization header as a Bearer token.
